`anik/dataset` is a PHP package for importing & exporting data within CSV & Database. You can use joins from multiple
tables. Create new columns for CSV, based on some calculation on available data. You don't need to put extra pressure on
your database anymore. Dataset supports all the databases which are supported by Laravel/Lumen. Because, internally it
uses Laravel's database package.
